    "## Notes:\n",
    "- Object-oriented programming, refered to as OOP, is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects allowing data to operate and be bound together\n",
    "- Classes are a template from which objects are created. Objects created under the same class will share common methods and attributes.\n",
    "- Objects are instances of a class.\n",
    "- Methods, or functions, are a set of code that perform a specific task.\n",
    "- Ex: class vegetables would have objects carrot, tomato, etc.\n",
    "- Class attributes (which the objects will inherit) could be calorie count, quantity, or other values relevant to the class\n",
    "- Methods of the class would be actions relevant to the class like consume or save\n",
    "- Classes in Java can contain data members, methods, constructors, nested classes, and interfaces.\n",
    "- To initialize an object, you need to use a class constructor\n",
    "- Defining and calling methods is advantageous because it allows for code reuse, optimization, and organization.\n",
    "- Calling a method:\n",
    "\tmethodName(parameter1, parameter2);\n",
    "- Calling an object's method:\n",
    "\tobjectReference.methodName(parameter1, parameter2);\n",
