Learning Inquiries . Is this program in more of an Imperative Programming Style or OOP style? Explain. Observe variable assignments. | Is each Monkey an object? | . | . This 2D array program is definatley more of an Imperative Programming Style rather than Object-Oriented Programming style. This is because the program just prints out a 2D array of monkeys which aren&#39;t object but just a string of ASCII characters. There is no class for monkey that has attributes and methods so the program dosen&#39;t use OOP and can be replicated in other languages .

            "content": "Question 1: . The APCalendar class contains methods used to calculate information about a calendar. You will write two methods of the class . public class APCalendar { /** Returns true if year is a leap year and false otherwise. */ private static boolean isLeapYear(int year) { /* implementation not shown */ } /** Returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive. * Precondition: 0 &lt;= year1 &lt;= year2 */ public static int numberOfLeapYears(int year1, int year2) { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ } /** Returns the value representing the day of the week for the first day of year, * where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., and 6 denotes Saturday. */ private static int firstDayOfYear(int year) { /* implementation not shown */ } /** Returns n, where month, day, and year specify the nth day of the year. * Returns 1 for January 1 (month = 1, day = 1) of any year. * Precondition: The date represented by month, day, year is a valid date. */ private static int dayOfYear(int month, int day, int year) { /* implementation not shown */ } /** Returns the value representing the day of the week for the given date * (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., * and 6 denotes Saturday. * Precondition: The date represented by month, day, year is a valid date. */ public static int dayOfWeek(int month, int day, int year) { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ } // There may be instance variables, constructors, and other methods not shown. } . (a) Write the static method numberOfLeapYears, which returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive. In order to calculate this value, a helper method is provided for you. . isLeapYear(year) returns true if year is a leap year and false otherwise. . Complete method numberOfLeapYears below. You must use isLeapYear appropriately to receive full credit. . /** Returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive. * Precondition: 0 &lt;= year1 &lt;= year2 */ public static int numberOfLeapYears(int year1, int year2) . Q1 a) Answer: . Given Info: the parameters year1 and year 2, the isLeapYear(year) method . Return Type: return type of numberOfLeapYears is int and I have to calculate the number of leap years between 2 years and return it. . public static int numberOfLeapYears(int year1, int year2) { int count = 0; for (int y = year1; y &lt;= year2; y++) { if (isLeapYear(y)){ count++; } } return count; } . import java.util.Calendar; import java.util.GregorianCalendar; public class APCalendar { /** Returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive. * Precondition: 0 &lt;= year1 &lt;= year2 */ public static int numberOfLeapYears(int year1, int year2) { int count = 0; for (int y = year1; y &lt;= year2; y++) { if (isLeapYear(y)){ count++; } } return count; } /** Returns true if year is a leap year and false otherwise. */ private static boolean isLeapYear(int year) { return new GregorianCalendar().isLeapYear(year); } public static void main(String[] args) { int answer = APCalendar.numberOfLeapYears(2000, 2050); System.out.println(&quot;Your answer should be 13: &quot; + answer); } } . FRQ 1 Question b) . Write the static method dayOfWeek, which returns the integer value representing the day of the week for the given date (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., and 6 denotes Saturday. For example, 2019 began on a Tuesday, and January 5 is the fifth day of 2019. As a result, January 5, 2019, fell on a Saturday, and the method call dayOfWeek(1, 5, 2019) returns 6. As another example, January 10 is the tenth day of 2019. As a result, January 10, 2019, fell on a Thursday, and the method call dayOfWeek(1, 10, 2019) returns 4. In order to calculate this value, two helper methods are provided for you . firstDayOfYear(year) returns the integer value representing the day of the week for the first day of year, where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, …, and 6 denotes Saturday. For example, since 2019 began on a Tuesday, firstDayOfYear(2019) returns 2. . dayOfYear(month, day, year) returns n, where month, day, and year specify the nth day of the year. For the first day of the year, January 1 (month = 1, day = 1), the value 1 is returned. This method accounts for whether year is a leap year. For example, dayOfYear(3, 1, 2017) returns 60, since 2017 is not a leap year, while dayOfYear(3, 1, 2016) returns 61, since 2016 is a leap year. . Complete method dayOfWeek below. You must use firstDayOfYear and dayOfYear appropriately to receive full credit. . /** Returns the value representing the day of the week for the given date * (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., * and 6 denotes Saturday. * Precondition: The date represented by month, day, year is a valid date. */ public static int dayOfWeek(int month, int day, int year) . Q1 Answer b) . public static int dayOfWeek(int month, int day, int year){ int firstDay = firstDayOfYear(year) int whichDay = dayOfYear(month,day,year); boolean leap = isLeapYear(year); int answer; if (leap == false){ int remainder = whichDay % 7; answer = remainder + firstDay-1; if (answer&gt;6){ answer = answer-7; } } else { int remainder = whichDay % 7; answer = remainder + firstDay; if (answer &gt; 6){ answer = answer -7 } } return answer . import java.util.Calendar; import java.util.GregorianCalendar; public class APCalendar { /** Returns the value representing the day of the week for the given date * (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., * and 6 denotes Saturday. * Precondition: The date represented by month, day, year is a valid date. */ public static int dayOfWeek(int month, int day, int year) { int firstDay = firstDayOfYear(year); int whichDay = dayOfYear(month,day,year); boolean leap = isLeapYear(year); int answer; if (leap == false){ int remainder = whichDay % 7; answer = remainder + firstDay-1; if (answer&gt;6){ answer = answer-7; } } else { int remainder = whichDay % 7; answer = remainder + firstDay; if (answer &gt; 6){ answer = answer -7; } } return answer; } public static void main(String[] args) { int answer = APCalendar.dayOfWeek(1, 8, 2019); System.out.println(&quot;Your answer should be 2: &quot; + answer); } /** Returns the value representing the day of the week for the first day of year, * where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., and 6 denotes Saturday. */ private static int firstDayOfYear(int year) { GregorianCalendar gc = new GregorianCalendar(year, Calendar.JANUARY, 1); return gc.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK) - 1; } /** Returns n, where month, day, and year specify the nth day of the year. * Returns 1 for January 1 (month = 1, day = 1) of any year. * Precondition: The date represented by month, day, year is a valid date. */ private static int dayOfYear(int month, int day, int year) { GregorianCalendar gc = new GregorianCalendar(year, month - 1, day); return gc.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR); } } .",

An if statement executes a block of code when a specified boolean expression is evaluated as true. . boolean condition = true; if (condition == true) { System.out.println(&quot;This code executes&quot;); } // Prints: This code executes if (condition == false) { System.out.println(&quot;This code does not execute&quot;); } // There is no output for the above statement .

The else statement is always the last condition. . boolean condition = false; if (condition){ System.out.println(&quot;condition is true&quot;); } else{ System.out.println(&quot;condition is not true&quot;); } // Prints: condition1 is not true . condition is not true . Else If Statement . Else-if statements can be chained together to check multiple conditions. Once a condition is true, a code block will be executed and the conditional statement will be exited. . int classGrade = 76; char grade; if (classGrade &gt;= 90) { grade = &#39;A&#39;; } else if (classGrade &gt;= 80) { grade = &#39;B&#39;; } else if (classGrade &gt;= 70) { grade = &#39;C&#39;; } else if (classGrade &gt;= 60) { grade = &#39;D&#39;; } else { grade = &#39;F&#39;; } System.out.println(grade); .

            "content": "Through this panel I learned a lot about a variety of individuals and their experiences with CSA/CSP and how it carries over into further education and the real world. The main takeaways from the talk was how all the members found their passion in the field of computer science and focused on that. Even if CS is not your favorite, it is important for a lot of fields and can provide a helpful structure for other areas like aerospace and mechanical engineering. There are a lot of different roles that you can specialize in which benefit from a knowledge of CS. I can relate this to myself because personally, I am not specifically sure if I want to be a Computer Science major or engineer, but a solid background in coding and computer science will benefit me and a variety of fields. Another important message I received was to focus on your own path and not to be discouraged by others and their success. Sometimes I get caught up in comparing myself with others and get discouraged when others are more advanced than me. Work on yourself! It’s more important to have fun with it, so you can feel motivated to work and challenge yourself. By doing so, you won’t feel the need to cut corners or check boxes and actually try and learn. CSA and CSP also help develop team skills that are important for college and the world and can help you with internship and job opportunities that will help you pursue a successful career and future. For me personally, my skills that I’ve learned from CSP and other resources have helped me be successful in my job at CodeNinjas. Web development and CS is so important and useful in a variety of jobs. Overall, this panel has helped me understand other people’s experiences and reflect on how I want to shape my future in the field of CS. Finally, I learned that clubs and extracurriculars, work experience, and internships can set you apart from the rest. At the end of the day, most colleges cs is the same and your GPAs is probably similar to everyone else, but building connections can help you stand out and be successful. .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
